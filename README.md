# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Kyan Hamad, a former Biochemist transitioning into the Tech field.

Currently, I am a student at Baruch College, majoring in CIS with a focus on Cybersecurity. During my downtime, I enjoy crafting light fixtures and vinyl displays, incorporating LEDs to enhance the ambiance of my NYC apartment. I specialize in flashing esp32s with WLED and soldering LED strips to have precise control over the lighting.

Feel free to explore my repositories to discover any ongoing or completed projects I've been passionately working on!
