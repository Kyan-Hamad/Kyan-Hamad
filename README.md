### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kyan Hamad and I am a former Biochemist moving to the Tech field.

I am a student at Baruch College studying CIS with a focus on Cybersecurity. In my downtime, I like to create light fixtures or vinyl displays and incorporate LEDs throughout my NYC apartment. I flash esp32s with [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) and solder LED strips to control the lighting.

Take a look at my repositories to see any current/finished projects I've been working on!
